Share my Recipe
-------
Share my Recipe is a new application that makes it easy for you to decide what to eat on a regular night. You probably have a few, say 5 or 6, standard dishes that you can always cook. But after cooking these a bunch of times, they can get a little bit boring and you might want to try something different. Of course you can use several existing applications to pick out a new dish, but often these give you way to much options and you end up spending a lot of time selecting one dish. That is were Share my Recipe comes in handy. At first, you will create an account an you can enter your 5/6 standard recipes and a short description of how to make them. Next, you can search friends of yours (by username) and add some of their standard recipes to your list. To make sure that your own list also does not become an extremely long list of possibilities, the amount of recipes you can add to it is limited. You can have at most 10 recipes in your list. If you already have 10 recipes in your list, and you want to add another one, you can delete one of the existing recipes.
